# Week 1
## What is functional interface?
Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface.

## What is memory leak?

A Memory Leak is a situation where there are objects present in the heap that are no longer used, but the garbage collector is unable to remove them from memory, and therefore, theyâ€™re unnecessarily maintained.

# Week 2
## Memory Types (Stack & Heap)

### What is stack?

Each Java Virtual Machine thread has a private Java Virtual Machine stack, created at the same time as the thread. A Java Virtual Machine stack stores frames.

### What is heap?

The Java Virtual Machine has a heap that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine threads. The heap is the run-time data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

The heap is created on virtual machine start-up. Heap storage for objects is reclaimed by an automatic storage management system (known as a garbage collector).

## Data Types & Immutable Types

### What is data Types?

The Java Virtual Machine operates on two kinds of types: primitive types and reference types. There are, correspondingly, two kinds of values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned by methods, and operated upon: primitive values and reference values.

More details:

Primitive Types and Values (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3)

Reference Types and Values (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.4)

### What is immutable types?

Immutable types are types of data objects whose state cannot be changed after they are created.

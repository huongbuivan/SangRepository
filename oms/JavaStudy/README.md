## What is functional interface?
Any interface with a SAM(Single Abstract Method) is a functional interface.

## What is memory leak?

A Memory Leak is a situation where there are objects present in the heap that are no longer used, but the garbage collector is unable to remove them from memory, and therefore, theyâ€™re unnecessarily maintained.

## Memory Types (Stack & Heap)

### What is stack?

Each Java Virtual Machine thread has a private Java Virtual Machine stack, created at the same time as the thread. A Java Virtual Machine stack stores frames.

ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.5.2

### What is heap?

The Java Virtual Machine has a heap that is shared among all Java Virtual Machine threads. The heap is the run-time data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

The heap is created on virtual machine start-up. Heap storage for objects is reclaimed by an automatic storage management system (known as a garbage collector).

## Data Types & Immutable Types

### What is data Types?

The Java Virtual Machine operates on two kinds of types: primitive types and reference types. There are, correspondingly, two kinds of values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned by methods, and operated upon: primitive values and reference values.

More details:

Primitive Types and Values (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.3)

Reference Types and Values (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se23/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.4)

### What is immutable types?

Immutable types are types of data objects whose state cannot be changed after they are created.

## What is concurrent programming?

Concurrent programming is a programming paradigm that enables multiple tasks to execute in overlapping time periods (concurrently), rather than sequentially.

### What is thread?

A thread is the smallest unit of execution.

### What is fork-join framework?

The Fork-Join Framework is a parallel programming framework in Java introduced in Java 7 as part of the java.util.concurrent package. It is designed to efficiently execute tasks that can be broken down into smaller, independent subtasks, and then combined to produce the final result.

### What is completableFuture?

A CompletableFuture in Java is a powerful and flexible feature introduced in Java 8 as part of the java.util.concurrent package. It represents a future result of an asynchronous computation and provides a framework to build complex asynchronous workflows.

### Compare ForkJoinPool with traditional threads?

## Comparison Table

| **Feature**            | **ForkJoinPool**                         | **Traditional Threads**               |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Parallelism**        | Splits tasks recursively into smaller tasks and processes them using a pool of worker threads.| Tasks are distributed manually across threads, requiring explicit synchronization and partitioning.|
| **Work-Stealing**      | Uses work-stealing to balance load dynamically across worker threads.| No built-in mechanism for work-stealing; load balancing must be handled explicitly.|
| **Ease of Use**     | Provides a high-level API to divide and combine tasks recursively.| Requires manual thread creation, task management, and coordination.|
| **Performance**        | More efficient for CPU-bound, fine-grained parallel tasks (e.g., summing large arrays).| May perform worse for fine-grained tasks due to thread overhead.|
| **Scalability**        | Scales well with the number of available processors.| Scalability is limited by thread overhead and management complexity.|
| **Complexity**  | Simplifies task decomposition and result aggregation.| Requires more boilerplate code for similar tasks.|

## What is Java cryptography?
Cryptography in Java involves securing information through encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption) using cryptographic algorithms.

### Key Components

_Encryption_: Converts plaintext into ciphertext using an algorithm and a key.

_Decryption_: Converts ciphertext back into plaintext using the same or a related key.

_Hashing_: Generates a fixed-size hash value from data, often used for integrity checks.

_Digital Signatures_: Provides data authenticity and integrity.

_Key Management_: Involves generating, distributing, and storing cryptographic keys securely.

### Common Cryptographic Algorithms in Java

1. Symmetric Encryption (Same Key):

Algorithms: AES, DES, Triple DES.

Use Case: Encrypting large data efficiently.

2. Asymmetric Encryption (Public and Private Keys):

Algorithms: RSA, Elliptic Curve.

Use Case: Securing key exchanges, digital signatures.

3. Hashing:

Algorithms: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512.

Use Case: Password storage, data integrity.

4. Key Derivation Functions:

Algorithms: PBKDF2.

Use Case: Deriving secure keys from passwords.

### Importance of Hashing in Security

1. Irreversible Transformation:

Hashing converts data (e.g., passwords) into a fixed-length string of characters.

It is a one-way function, meaning the original data cannot be retrieved from the hash.

2. Password Storage:

Plaintext passwords are a significant security risk.
Storing hashed passwords ensures that even if the database is compromised, the passwords are not directly accessible.

3. Data Integrity:

Hashes are used to verify the integrity of data. Even a small change in the original data results in a completely different hash.

4. Resistance to Attacks:

Combined with techniques like salting (adding random data before hashing), it becomes resistant to rainbow table attacks and brute force attempts.

5. Compliance:

Many security standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) require the secure handling of sensitive data, including hashing passwords.
